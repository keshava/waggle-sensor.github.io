## April 29:  Plenary (TCS Conference Rooms 1404-1405)
* __09:00 Introduction:__ _Welcome, Workshop Outcomes_
* __09:10 SAGE Vision:__ _AI@Edge as an Enabling Architecture (Rick Stevens)_
* __09:45 Plenary 1:__ _Convergent Science Driving Measurement Capabilities_
	- Moderator: Jim Olds, GMU
	- Purpose: Begin to Form a set of science questions that will drive SAGE, with testable hypotheses that require SAGE research infrastructure to measure.
	- Format: Each panelist will address the following:
	* What science does today’s instruments support (for me)
	* What unique new measurements will AI@Edge enable
	* What testable hypothesis might we investigate with these new measurements
	* Describe the national-scale experiment that could leverage AI@Edge in NEON, AoT, ARM, HPWREN, LPZoo, etc. to test this hypothesis.
	- Panelists: Jim Olds, GMU; Christina Negri, UChicago; Scott Collis, ANL; Dan Work, Vanderbilt; Ilkay Altintas, SDSC; Kathleen Cagney, UChicago; 
	- Panel Discussion: What Convergent Questions Cut Across Many Scales? Disciplines?

* __11:15 Break__

* __11:30 Plenary 2:__ Architecture of a National Infrastructure
	- Moderator: Pete Beckman, NU
	- Purpose: Establish a common vision for exactly what SAGE will look like and how it will provide measurements to examine the convergent science questions.
	- Format: Short talks each outlining vision for some facet of SAGE

	- Vision: An Integrated Research Infrastructure (Beckman, 30 min)
	- Resilient Edge Computing Hardware and New Sensors (Sankaran, 10 min)
	- Programming Environment and Data Pipeline (Altintas, 10 min)

* __12:30 Lunch__

* __13:00 Vendor Lunch Round Table:  NVIDIA, ARM, HPE__
	- Moderator: Nicola Ferrier, Northwestern
	- Purpose: Overview of AI@Edge Benchmarks and Use Cases possible with emerging (2019) and forecasted (2022) AI@Edge hardware technologies
	- Format: 6-minute talks describing AI@Edge use cases, followed by round table Q&A: ARM, HPE, NVIDIA

* __14:00 Plenary 3: SAGE Partner Instruments: How Will AI@Edge Be Integrated__
	- Moderator: Charlie Catlett, UChicago
	- Purpose: Preliminary descriptions of what new measurements, sensors, AI@Edge capabilities, will be required for each instrument (e.g., what will the Waggle configuration look like for each instrument?).
	- Format: 8-minute talks describing how AI@Edge/Waggle will be integrated to augment each instrument
	- NEON (Eugene Kelly, CSU) 
	- AoT (Charlie Catlett , UChicago)
	- HPWREN (Ilkay Altintas, SDSC)
	- ARM (Scott Collis, NU)
	- LPZoo (Seth Magle, LPZoo)

* __15:00 Plenary Session 4: Round Table on Bringing the Vision & Science Together__
	- Moderator: Dan Work, Vanderbilt
	- Purpose: Review the science discussions, instrument architecture, and vision - What are the key challenges?  How do our science challenges relate to NSF Big Ideas? Convergent Science?  What are we missing?.  
	- Format: Panel Discussion and Round Table

	- Panelists:  Dan Work (Vanderbilt), Jim Olds (GMU), Valerie Taylor (UChicago), Nicki Hickmon (ANL), Pete Beckman (NU)

* __16:00 (adjourn for those not leading working groups or serving as scribes)__

* __16:00 Working Group Leaders and Scribes Planning Session__
	- Purpose: Proposal Outline Review and Working Group plans

	- Convergent Science Questions (Jim Olds, GMU; Dan Work, Vanderbilt; Marc Berman, UChicago)
Charter: Outline multiple convergent science questions and their testable hypotheses.
	- B. Cyberinfrastructure (Pete Beckman, NU; Nicola Ferrier, UChicago)
Charter: Outline hardware and software development required to build and operate SAGE.
	- C. Broader Impacts (Valerie Taylor, UChicago; Stacie Williams, UChicago; Michael Papka, NIU))
Charter: Outline broadening participation, training, and education efforts including data dissemination to diverse scientific and other communities to provide a persistent national data resource.
	- D. Project Management, Construction, Operation (Charlie Catlett, UChicago; Brenna Berman, City Tech)

## April 30: Working Group Breakout Sessions (TCS Conference Center, and rooms to be announced)
* __09:00  Working Groups Session 1: Survey, Inventory, Outline__
	- Purpose: Refine and finalize outline of assigned proposal sections, lay out big questions, plans, etc. for each.  What are the “big take-away” messages for these sections?

* __10:45 Break__

* __11:00 Working Groups Session 2: Initial Drafts__
	- Purpose: Create a draft of each proposal section in bullet form highlighting the major points to be covered and the structure (subsections) of each section.

* __12:30 Lunch__

(adjourn for those not leading working groups or serving as scribes)

* __13:30 Working Group Leads and Scribes Convene__
	- Purpose: Create a draft of the proposal, identify holes and outline changes needed, review proposal completion schedule (proposal is due May 20, 2019)

* __15:30 Adjourn__
