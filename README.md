## April 29:  Plenary 
* __09:00 Introduction:__ _Welcome, Workshop Outcomes_
* __09:10 SAGE Vision:__ _AI@Edge as an Enabling Architecture_
* __09:45 Plenary 1:__ _Convergent Science Driving Measurement Capabilities_
	- Moderator: Dan Reed, Utah
	- Purpose: Begin to Form a set of science questions that will drive SAGE, with testable hypotheses that require SAGE research infrastructure to measure.
	- Format: Each panelist will address the following:
		* What science does today’s instruments support (for me)
		* What unique new measurements will AI@Edge enable
		* What testable hypothesis might we investigate with these new measurements
		* Describe the national-scale experiment that could leverage AI@Edge in NEON, AoT, ARM, HPWREN, LPZoo, etc. to test this hypothesis.
	- Panelists: Jim Olds, GMU; Christina Negri, UChicago; Eugene Kelly, CSU; Dan Work, Vanderbilt; Ilkay Altintas, SDSC; Howard Nusbaum, UChicago
	- Panel Discussion: What Convergent Questions Cut Across Many Scales? Disciplines?

* __11:15 Break__
* __11:30  Plenary 2:__ Architecture of a National Infrastructure
	- Moderator: Pete Beckman, NU
	- Purpose: Establish a common vision for exactly what SAGE will look like and how it will provide measurements to examine the convergent science questions.
	- Format: Short talks each outlining vision for some facet of SAGE
	- Vision: An Integrated Research Infrastructure (Beckman, 30 min)
	- Resilient Edge Computing Hardware and New Sensors (Sankaran, 10 min)
	- Programming Environment and Data Pipeline (Keahy, 10 min)
	- ML Inference at the Edge and Training in the Cloud (Ferrier, 10 min)
* __12:30 Lunch__
* __13:30 Plenary 3:__ SAGE Partner
 Instruments: How Will AI@Edge Be Integrated
Moderator: Charlie Catlett, UChicago
Purpose: Preliminary descriptions
 of what new measurements, sensors, AI@Edge capabilities, will be required for each instrument (e.g., what will the Waggle configuration look like for each instrument?).
Format: Short talks describing how
 AI@Edge/Waggle will be integrated to augment the instrument
